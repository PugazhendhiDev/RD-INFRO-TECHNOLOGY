        <p>
          Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, is one of the most iconic
          superheroes in the Marvel universe. What makes him truly admirable is
          that he has no superpowers — instead, he relies on his intelligence,
          creativity, and determination. As a genius inventor and billionaire,
          Tony uses his resources not for selfish reasons, but to protect the
          world from threats.

        <p>
          One of Iron Man's most inspiring qualities is his ability to learn
          from his mistakes. After a life-changing experience as a weapons
          manufacturer, Tony chose to change his path and work for peace. This
          transformation shows his strong sense of responsibility and moral
          growth, which many people admire.

          <h1 class="heading">Courage And Sacrifice</h1>
          <p>
            Iron Man is also known for his bravery. Whether facing alien
            invasions or powerful villains, he never backs down. He often puts
            others before himself, even if it means risking his life. His
            sacrifice in Avengers: Endgame proves just how selfless and heroic
            he truly is.

          <p>
            Apart from being a hero, Tony Stark has a witty personality and a
            sharp sense of humor. His confidence, charm, and leadership make him
            a natural role model. Despite his flaws, he always tries to do
            what’s right, showing that even imperfect people can be heroes.

          <p>
            Iron Man's journey reminds us that true strength comes from within —
            from our choices, values, and willingness to stand up for others. He
            is more than just a man in a suit; he is a symbol of courage,
            change, and hope.
